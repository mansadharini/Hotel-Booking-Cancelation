# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The booking details of a resort in Portugal between the 1st  of July 2015 and 31st  of August 2017 are provided. The resort is facing loss in revenue due to cancellations by the customers resulting in the room lying vacant. 

SOLUTION:
The likelihood of a booking to be cancelled has thus been determined based on the models built with an accuracy of 90%.
These prediction models enable hotel managers to mitigate revenue loss from booking cancellations.
Booking cancellations models also allow hotel managers to implement less rigid cancellation policies. This has the potential to translate into more sales, since less rigid cancellation policies generate more bookings
